# Ystudio Zero

lays the groundwork for capturing, visualizing and analyzing
real time data obtained from Ylab sensors. 

It uses Egui for a light-weight and portable user interface and 
the architecture is already multi-threading safe. This will allow to collect 
from multiple sources simultaneously.

Once Ystudio Zero is finished, more specialized applications can
be developed after its blueprint.
